# C5-CodeAnnotations
This project explores the concepts of code annotations focusing on attributes, decorators, and assertions. Our goal is to show and explain these types of annotations using Python which will be done by Julian and Java which will be done by Ryan. We will compare and contrast the differences between the two languages in how they handle and use these code annotations to help readers of the code understand it more and make it more user-friendly
