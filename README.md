# Code Annotations: Attributes, Decorators, and Assertions

## Group: Ryan (Java) and Julian (Python)

This repository explores the use of code annotations, specifically attributes, decorators, and assertions, in Java and Python. The concepts will be demonstrated in the context of a calculator implementation in each language.

## Introduction
Code annotations are powerful features in programming languages that allow developers to add metadata or modify behavior to their code. In this repository, we focus on attributes, decorators, and assertions in Java and Python. The implementations of these concepts are showcased in a calculator application written by Ryan in Java and Julian in Python.

## Calculator Implementation
The calculator implementations serve as the practical application of the discussed code annotations. Both implementations will cover basic arithmetic operations and demonstrate the use of attributes, decorators, and assertions.

## Code Annotations
### Attributes
Attributes provide a way to associate metadata with program elements such as classes, methods and fields. In the context of our calculator, attributes will be used to enhance the understanding of the code structure and behavior.

### Decorators
Python decorators are a powerful and flexible way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods, we will be demonstrating how they can simplify code and enhance readability.

### Assertions
Assertions are statements that assert or guarantee a condition to be true at a particular point in the code, ensuring the correctness of calculations and providing a level of debugging support.

## Considerations

### Computational Complexity
We will discuss the computational complexity of the calculator implementations, analysing the efficiency of the algorithms used for basic arithmetic operations.

### Execution Time
Benchmarking and profiling will be performed to measure and compare the execution time of the Java and Python calculator implementations.

### Examples of Code
The repository includes comprehensive examples of code snippets showcasing the use of attributes, decorators, and assertions in both Java and Python.

### Standard Library vs Ad-hoc Implementations
We will compare the benefits and drawbacks of utilising standard library features versus ad-hoc implementations for code annotations in the context of our calculator applications.
